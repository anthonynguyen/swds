swds is a simple PHP script that can be used to share the contents of a directory. Just plop it in and you're ready to go.

*Warning*: swds comes with a feature to password-protect a folder, but this only prevents the contents from being listed. If a person knows the filename they want, it's up to your web server to protect it.
